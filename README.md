This is the beginnings of a client for the Wordfeud (wordfeud.com) game. The
goal of this client is to interoperate with the commercial and other
implementations of Wordfeud. This software is in no way associated with the
original Wordfeud software, so don't go email them if this software doesn't
work the way you want it to.

Beware that the code is a bit hackish. Read & run at your own risk.

WHAT DO I NEED TO DO TO RUN IT?
-------------------------------

You need to supply your username and password in ~/.wf_login.txt. First line is
your email, second line is your password. 

Run the application by starting the tkgui.py file with python. I've tested
using python 2.7.2. You need Tkinter for the GUI.

CAN I CONTRIBUTE?
-----------------

Yes! Send me pull requests at github.

HOW DOES IT LOOK?
-----------------

It looks like this:
